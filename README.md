# Chess Engine

## Aim

I want to write some c code that will beat me in a game of chess.

## Implementation

Currently working on defining the pseudo-legal move generation for each piece using bitboards. I'd like to use magic bitboards for the sliding pieces. C felt like the natural choice for bit-wise operations, speed and direct memory location access.
